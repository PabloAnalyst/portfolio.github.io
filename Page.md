# PRODUCT PORTFOLIO DATA ANALYST PABLOAN


## INTRODUCTION
Pablo An, an Industrial Engineer specialized in Data Analytics, with experience in data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. I am proficient in advanced operations in Excel and DAX, Power BI, as well as knowledgeable in Python (Pandas Matplotlib), SQL, Tableau, and Looker Studio.

As an Analyst, my role has enabled me to present data reliably and accurately, reduce the cognitive load of end-users, and utilize Storytelling in the final output. I can generate indicators based on data and client needs, and I have experience in data analysis to identify opportunities and improvements in business processes.

I would be delighted to review any project you have to determine how to carry out the project based on your needs and time availability. Below, I will provide more detailed information about my experience and skills, as well as some of the projects I have completed.
